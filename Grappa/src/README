The shell scripts in this directory (mk, mkCup, mkDoc, postDoc) assume that
the shell environmental variables:

   JAVACUP
   JAVAHOME
   JDK

are set and exported.  JAVACUP should point to the root directory of the
JavaCup tool, which is available from:

     http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/

Although you may want to have the most up-to-date version of JavaCup, you
really only need to get it if you wish to regenerate the parser and symbol
java files from the parser cup file.  This source distribution comes with
the JavaCup runtime files you would need to use Grappa.

JAVAHOME should point to the root directory of the JDK distribution, which is
available from:

     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/

and JDK should be set to jdk1.1 unless you are working with the JDK 1.0 version
of Grappa and then the value of the JDK variable should be jdk1.0 (and
JAVAHOME should point to a 1.0.2 version of the JDK and you should use
JavaCup 0.9e in the directory pointed to by JAVACUP).

To compile Grappa, you may first need to run "mkParser" to have JavaCup generate
the parser and symbol files from the source cup file (those files have already
been generated, so you should not need to run "mkParser").  To run, "mkParser",
simply type its name at the shell prompt.  No arguments are needed.

To actually generate the Grappa class files, run "mk" without any arguments.
By default, "mk" will put the class files under the root directory
$HOME/java, but you can change that by setting and exporting the shell
variable OUTROOT.

You can use "mkCup" to generate the JavaCup runtime classes. They will be
installed under the same root as the Grappa class files.

You can use javadoc to generate html documentation by running "mkDoc" followed
by "postDoc" if you wish to link to Sun JDK documentation and limit the
class hierarchy to Grappa and related classes. The "postDoc" program uses the
packages.src and tree.src files to replaced the "mkDoc" generated versions
("postDoc" also uses "sed" on the generated files to change the hyperlink
information for the JDK files).
