A Java <I><U>Grap</U></I>h <I><U>Pa</U></I>ckage</H1>
<P>Grappa is a <A TARGET=sun HREF="http://java.sun.com/">Java</A> graph drawing package that simplifies the inclusion of graph
display and manipulation capabilities within <I>Java</I> applications and applets. It has a good number of useful
features built into it, but is also extensible.</P>

Grappa can be thought of as a port of a subset of <A TARGET=graphviz HREF="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</A> to <I>Java</I>.</P>
<P>The current version of Grappa was built using the <A TARGET=sun HREF="http://java.sun.com/">Java Development Kit (JDK)</A>
version 1.2  and takes advantage of recent improvements in the JDK such as
<A TARGET=sun HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/2d/index.html">Java 2D</A> and
<A TARGET=sun HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/index.html">Swing</A>.
Browser users can obtain free <A TARGET=sun HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/index.html">plug-ins via
Sun</A> to make their browsers capable of running JDK1.2.

<P>You can download a copy of the
Grappa  source, documentation and archive files by going to the
<A HREF="http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php" target="download">
Graphviz download page</A> and selecting the <I>Download Grappa</I> link
in the <B><I>Java Support</I></B> section.
<A HREF="/~john/Grappa/docs/att/grappa/package-summary.html" target="javadocs">On-line documentation</A> and a <A TARGET=grappa HREF="/~john/Grappa/grappa1_2.html">demo</A>
are also available (you will need the above mentioned plug-in for the demo, though).</P>

<P>
Regarding the
<A TARGET=grappa HREF="/~john/Grappa/grappa1_2.html">demo that uses the JDK1.2 plug-in</A>,
depending on your browser, your platform, etc., the particular plug-in you use may introduce some flakiness into the demo.
If you want to demo the 1.2 version of Grappa more reliably, you could try pointing a Java 1.2 appletviewer to http://www.research.att.com/~john/Grappa/grappa1_2.applet instead.
<P>

<P><A NAME="Features"></A><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Features</B></FONT></P>

<P>Some of the features of Grappa are:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>methods for building, manipulating, traversing and displaying graphs of nodes, edges and subgraphs;
	<LI>each graph element may have associated with it any number of arbitrary name/value attributes;
	<LI>certain specific attributes affect element position and appearance when displayed;
	<LI>Grappa includes methods for reading in and writing out graphs using the <A TARGET=graphviz HREF="http://www.graphviz.org/">dot</A>
	text format (graphs may also be created by directly using the available element creation methods or interactively
	with a mouse);
	<LI>a utility is provided to easily allow batch processing of a graph by a layout or other graph processing program;
	<LI>interactive means are provided for creating and deleting graph elements as well as selection and deletion;
	<LI>a wide range of node shapes are available;
	<LI>a single graph can be displayed in multiple windows;
	<LI>pop-up labelling (also known as a ToolTip) is available for any displayed element simply by defining a <I>tip</I>
	attribute.
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Additional Information</B></FONT></P>

<P>The source for earlier JDK1.0 and JDK1.1 versions of Grappa
is also included in the Grappa distribution.</P>
The
<A TARGET=grappa HREF="/~john/Grappa/grappa1_1.html">JDK1.1 Demo</A>
and the
<A TARGET=grappa HREF="/~john/Grappa/grappa1_0.html">JDK1.0 Demo</A>
are still available.
You may, however, need to re-start your browser when you switch from one version of the demo to another as caching will most likely cause confusion since there is a great deal of name-space overlap among the versions.
