	<h1>1. Design Concepts of the Intermediate Representations in COINS</h1>

<h3 id='i-1-1'>1.1. Preface</h3>    

  There are two intermediate representations in COINS, namely, High level
intermediate representation HIR and low level intermediate representation LIR. 
Following documents give the general view of them:

<ul>
<li><a href='../hir/HirOutlineE-frame.html' target="_top">Outline of the High level Intermediate Representation HIR</a></li>
<li><a href='../hir/HirSemanticsE-frame.html' target="_top">Semantics of the High level Intermediate Representation HIR</a></li>

<!--
<li><a href='../lir/LirSpecE.pdf' target="_top">LIR specifications (pdf)</a></li>
-->
</ul>

The IR is intended to be the super class of HIR and LIR. The interface of
symbol table information supplements them. All compiler modules are 
linked with each other via these intermediate representations.
<br>
  Above outline documents describe the design policies and intentions, but 
do not give the specifications of individual methods. Readers are asked to 
refer to the interface specifications for that purpose as explained later.

<h3 id='i-1-2'>1.2. Design policy of the intermediate representations</h3> 

<h4 id='i-1-2-1'>1.2.1. Overall policy </h4>

<h5 id='i-1-2-1-1'>1.2.1.1. The role of intermediate representations</h5>
  In general, a compiler transforms a source program to an object program. 
The transformation is done in several phases such as syntax analysis, code 
optimization, code generation, etc. In this process, the source program is 
transformed to some intermediate representation that is easier to handle 
by compiler modules than source program.  Ad hoc representations corresponding 
to combinations of neighboring modules will make the compiler complicated and 
difficult to be expanded.  If we can settle an intermediate representation 
as an interface common between all modules of the compiler, then the compiler 
can be simplified and made easy to be expanded.<br>
  COINS is the compiler infrastructure that is intended to be expanded to build 
various compilers by adding or modifying compiler modules. It is intended to 
build compilers for many languages and also compilers for many machines. 
It is also intended to build compilers generating good object code and 
compilers having distinguished characteristics such as parallelization, etc.<br>
  How to define an intermediate representation that fits to such requirements 
is the problem.

<h5 id='i-1-2-1-2'>1.2.1.2. Requirements for intermediate representations</h5>
  In compiling a source program into object code, there is a sequence of 
transformations which are carried out by compiler modules such as syntax 
analyzer, flow analyzer, optimizer, parallelizer, register allocator, code 
generator, and so on. By adding or replacing some of them we can construct 
various compilers. If we can define an intermediate representation that 
has the role of common interface between compiler modules, then it will become 
easy to add, delete, or replace compiler modules to construct a new compiler.
To realize such interface, requirements for the intermediate representation 
are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Capable of representing the structure and meaning of given program 
    in detail.</li>
<li>Suitable for processing of analysis and transformation.</li>
<li>Suitable for generating efficient object code.</li>
<li>Highly extensible.</li>
<li>Suitable for high speed processing in short memory space.</li>
</ul>

As for COINS, more specifically speaking, 
<ul>
<li>Extensible to many imperative languages.</li>
<li>Extensible to many machines.</li>
<li>Afford to be extended for future needs in long period.</li>
<li>Information for optimization, parallelization etc. can be easily attached.</li>
</ul>
are required.

<h4 id='i-1-2-2'>1.2.2. The Levels of the Intermediate Representations</h4>
  
  There might be several levels in defining intermediate representation, from 
high level near to source language to low level near to machine language.<br>

  In the course of program transformation, there are several processings
that are suitable to be designed in a level near source language, and also 
there are several other processings that are suitable to be designed in a level 
near machine language.<br>
  Processings suitable for the level near source language are
<ul>
<li>dependency analysis for optimization and parallelization</li>
<li>loop transformation</li>
<li>inline expansion</li>
</ul>
and so on.<br>
  Processings suitable for the level near machine language are
<ul>
<li>register allocation</li>
<li>instruction scheduling</li>
<li>memory access optimization</li>
</ul>
and so on.<br>

  If we define an intermediate representation at only one level, then some 
processings are suitable for it but there will be some of other processings 
that are not suitable for it. It is better to define high level intermediate 
representation and low level intermediate representation. There might be an 
opinion that defining two levels of intermediate representation causes to 
increase the number of transformations in the course of compilation and 
makes it impossible to build one-pass compiler. It is true but one-pass 
compilers can not generate good code and it will be permissible to exclude
such compilers from the covering range of COINS. Practical compilers have
many passes to produce good code, and so, it will be permissible to insert 
a pass to convert intermediate representation from high level to low level.<br>

There might be another opinion that two levels of intermediate representation 
requires two set of modules to manage intermediate representations and causes 
to increase the amount of development. The size of modules to manage intermediate
representations will not be so large and its development is done only once 
by implementers of the infrastructure and if the complexity of some compiler 
modules decreases, then the total amount of development will be decreased 
since such decrease will be seen in many compilers developed by using the 
infrastructure, and it means that many users of the infrastructure will 
have benefit.<br>

  There will be another choice to define more than two levels of intermediate
representations. Intermediate representation may have many attributes that
are filled or deleted in the process of compilation and some fields may be
replaced with different kind of items. For example, an operand of an expression
may be changed from source program variable to abstract register and then 
changed to physical register without changing basic structure of the expression.
This means that one intermediate representation can cover many phases of 
compiling process and requests for more than two levels of intermediate 
representation will not be so strong.<br>

  It may be necessary to define more than two levels of intermediate 
representations for some complicated languages. For example, C language 
has many complicated operators and assignment statement embedded in expressions,
therefore it may be better to have another intermediate representation near
C language. For another example, object oriented languages require complicated
treatment of objects and methods, therefore it may be better to have another 
intermediate representation suitable to object oriented languages.<br>

  In designing intermediate representations of COINS, we decided to have
two levels of intermediate representations, that is,
    high level intermediate representation HIR and <br>
    low level intermediate representation LIR <br>
as ones applicable to all cases. HIR is an intermediate representation 
that can cover analysis and transformation on the level of many imperative 
languages. LIR is an intermediate representation that can cover analysis and
transformation on the level of many target machines.<br>
  As for other levels of intermediate representation, it will be decided to be
introduced only when its necessity become quite obvious for some language 
groups or for some architecture groups.<br>

<h4 id='i-1-2-3'>1.2.3. Treatment of dependencies</h4>

  It is desirable that intermediate representations are independent of
languages and machines. If it is possible, then many compiler modules can be 
shared between many compilers corresponding to various combinations of source 
languages and target machines, except for language analyzers corresponding to 
specific language and last phases of code generation corresponding to specific 
target machine. In rigorous meaning, it will be very difficult.<br>
  Some language dependencies will remain in intermediate representations. 
For example, a string constant may contain language specific mark or size 
information to delimit the sequence of characters contained in the string.
Some machine dependencies will remain in intermediate representations. 
For example, the size of integer number may be 32 bits or 64 bits depending 
on target machine even for the same source program.<br>
  It can be noticed that such differences are one of variations for each
kind of language items. We can define the grammar of an intermediate 
representation as one independent of languages and machines leaving possibility
of language/machine dependencies for some symbols used in the representation.
In terms of programming languages, the interface specifications are 
completely independent of source languages and target machines but their field
values may have some dependencies on languages and machines, that is, 
the specifications of the intermediate representation is independent of 
languages and machines but its instance may have dependencies.<br>
  In this approach, most compiler modules can be implemented almost independent
of languages and machines because the interface specifications of the 
intermediate representation are independent of languages and machines. Some
small portions of compiler modules may have dependencies on languages or machines
to handle the contents of fields having dependency. In this approach, 
the intermediate representation generated for some specific machine can not be 
applied to generate machine code of other architecture having different 
characteristics because the instance of the intermediate representation may 
have dependency on the target machine. It is the point that differs from the 
bytecode of Java. <br>
  We take above approach and do not take the approach of Java bytecode
because above approach will be suitable for generating highly efficient
object code compared to the approach of the bytecode.

<h4 id='i-1-2-4'>1.2.4. IR, HIR, LIR</h4>
    
<h5 id='i-1-2-4-1'>1.2.4.1. IR</h5>

  In the first stage of COINS development, HIR and LIR are designed to be
a subclass of an intermediate representation named IR in order to make some
modules common between HIR and LIR. 
<pre>
    IR _____ HIR
        |
        |___ LIR
</pre>
Actually, the first version of LIR was implemented as the subclass of IR 
and a flow analyzer has been built to be able to analyze both HIR and LIR. 
The second version of code generator has been implemented based on new 
implementation of LIR, although its basic design is the same to that of LIR 
version 1. <br>
  At present, the new LIR is not yet made a subset of IR, and so, the hierarchy
of IR is
<pre>
    IR _____ HIR

             LIR
</pre>
It is a future work to make it possible to build modules that are applicable
both to HIR and LIR.

<h5 id='i-1-2-4-2'>1.2.4.2. HIR</h5>

  If we pursuit what is essential in programming languages, we can get the 
image of an elementary programming language that is common to many imperative
languages. HIR is based on such elementary language which contains most of 
high level language concepts common between imperative languages. The document<br>
    Outline of High level Intermediate Representation HIR<br>
describes about the elementary language.<br>
  Too much decomposition of high level language concepts will make the 
intermediate representation not suitable for program analyses based on
high level language concepts. Considering it, in HIR, array element expressions
are not decomposed to pointer expressions.  Compound expressions such as 
compound assignment in C are decomposed into elementary expressions because
such expressions requires special treatment for C language in data flow analysis, 
etc. that is desirable to be language independent.<br>
  It will be necessary to expand current specifications of HIR when we want 
to apply COINS to languages based on different concepts. For example, 
object oriented languages may require special considerations in compilation.
How to treat them in HIR is left as a future problem.

<h5 id='i-1-2-4-3'>1.2.4.3. LIR</h5>

  LIR is designed to make many compiler components common between various 
machines. Code optimizer is one of major components in practical compilers. For 
the code optimization, efficient use of registers is very important. Considering 
it, registers should be explicitly represented in LIR. In the bytecode of Java, 
portability of object code is a major concern and does not represent registers 
explicitly. In COINS, importance is attached to the code optimization and
applicability to many machines is pursuit by increasing retargetability.<br>
  LIR is, there for, based on a model of abstract register machine. In this
model, computation is carried on by evaluating expressions and setting results 
to variables. A variable has its value in memory or register. Expressions 
may stand for a constant, a variable, or an operation of arbitrary complexity
using expressions as their operands. There are control operations such as
jump, conditional branch, and call. Most computers have such elementary 
operations as add, subtract, multiply, divide, shift, compare, and so on.
Operators in LIR represent such operations.<br>
  While elementary operations are similar between machines, the mechanism of 
call/return and procedures of entry/exit for subprograms differ greatly machine 
by machine. To deal with such variety, call, return, prolog, epilog operators
are provided in LIR and their expansion to machine instruction sequence is
left as the work of retargeting.<br>
  In currently prevailing architectures, data are represented as binary integer 
or floating point number. Character code and boolean value can be represented as 
a binary integer of small size. LIR representation of data values takes these
forms. The length of data is represented by the number of bits required to 
represent it. The address of memory is represented in byte of 8 bit length. 
Data may be a scalar or an aggregate. For example, 64 bits data may represent
64 bit integer or 4 element array of 16 bit integer. In LIR, aggregate data is
distinguished from scalar data.<br>
  LIR is defined as a complete low level programming language. It can be 
expressed in textual form as well as in internal representation suitable for 
processing by compiler modules. Usually, a program in LIR is constructed by 
the HIR-to-LIR translator but it can be input to or output from  the compiler 
in textual form. 

<h4 id='i-1-2-5'>1.2.5. Retargeting</h4>

  There will appear various kind of computer architectures. COINS has retargeting
feature so that it can be applied to new computer architecture easily. COINS
generates code generator for a new machine based on specifications named 
Target Machine Description (TMD). The code generator looks for the best fit 
combination of LIR subtree pattern and corresponding target machine code 
sequence to generate machine code.<br>
  There are many passes of LIR transformations such as optimizers and register
allocator. In this process of transformation, the fields of LIR will change 
according to the target machine but the grammar of LIR is the same during
these transformations. For example, an operand may be changed from variable to
abstract register and then real register of the target machine keeping the
structure defined by the LIR grammar. LIR subtrees representing an assignment 
statement will be decomposed into a sequence of small subtrees each of which
corresponds to actual instruction of the target machine keeping the structure
defined by the LIR grammar. This means that most of backend modules can be constructed
machine independently except for the last phase that generates assembly language
program of the target machine. Thus, control flow graph constructor, SSA 
optimizer, register allocator, instruction scheduler, etc. are made to be 
common between all target machines.<br>
  In many cases, code generators for new machines generating fairly good code 
have been developed in 3 to 6 months. 


<h3 id='i-1-3'>1.3. Symbol table</h3>

  There are such symbols as variables, subprograms, and others in a program. 
Since symbols in character strings are not easy to handle, they are registered 
in the symbol table and are handled as symbol table entries in intermediate 
representations. Attributes of a symbol are attached to its entry in the symbol 
table. Many of these attributes are decided by declarative statements and the 
structure of the program, or set at the time of syntax analysis and semantic 
analysis. <br>
  In LIR, attributes of symbols are rather simple and their declarations are
contained in LIR. In HIR, attributes of symbols are complex reflecting the 
complexity of declaration statements.<br>
  HIR does not hold declaration statements of symbols but attributes of symbols
are retained in the symbol table. The symbol table of HIR retains information 
not only of variables and subprogram but also of constants, types, and all 
other symbols, including compiler generated temporary variables and labels, and 
these symbols are referred to during compilation. It may be thought that 
constants need not be included in the symbol table. A constant is, however, not 
always represented in one word, and the precision and the range a constant 
represents vary among different compiling environments and target machines. 
Complexity of compiler development will be a little lightened by including 
constants in the symbol table.<br>
  Symbols may have attributes that depend on source language or target machine.
Large portions of compiler modules, however,  do not distinguish such dependencies. <br>
By hiding such dependencies to the symbol table, greater commonality of the 
compiler modules could be realized.<br>

<h3 id='i-1-4'>1.4. Links to detailed specifications</h3>

  There are several other documents that explain internal representations as
it is mentioned in Preface. The outline documents listed up in Preface do
not explain details necessary for coding modules to be integrated in COINS.
For that purpose, it is necessary to read interfaces of HIR, etc.
The recommended order of reading documents is as follows.<br>
<br>
 (1) This document<br>
 (2) Other outline documents<br>
 (3) The Java interfaces for HIR<br>
 (4) The Java interfaces which are the subclasses of above Java interfaces <br>
<br>
  Interfaces that describes detailed specifications of HIR:
<pre>
    HIR.java     interface specifications for HIR
    Sym.java     interface specifications for the symbol table
    Type.java    interface specifications for the types 
    Flow.java    interface specifications for the flow information
    BBlock.java  interface specifications for the basic blocks
                 to be used in flow analysis
    MachineParam.java    class for machine dependent information 
    SourceLanguage.java  class for source language dependent information
</pre>

  In developing modules using HIR, users need only to consult the interface 
specifications to understand, and need not to go down to the implementation 
details. In consulting the interface specifications, it is suggested to first 
consult the specifications in the uppermost classes listed above. Only when 
further specifics are required, user may look for appropriate lower classes. 
In other words, it is strongly recommended to try first and make most use of 
the applicable methods in the uppermost classes, and not to start from a subclass. If one start reading from lower subclasses, he/she may be misguided to
wrong applications of methods due to the lack of the knowledge 
of underlying conventions.<br>
  The classes listed below are prepared for overall control of the compiler. 
They may be referred to in the intermediate representation specifications.
<pre>
      Driver      compiler path control
      IoRoot      links to input/output related information
      SymRoot     links to symbol table related matters
      HirRoot     links to HIR information 
      LirRoot     links to LIR information
      FlowRoot    links to flow information
