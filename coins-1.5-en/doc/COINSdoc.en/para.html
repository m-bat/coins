<h3 id='i-6-1'>6.1. Loop Parallelizer</h3>    

"coins.lparallel" package analyzes the program for parallelizable loops and outputs the C
code with applicable OpenMP pragma directives. It does not do the
parallelization itself, but the driver can call an external OpenMP compiler.

<h4 id='i-6-1-1'>6.1.1.  Usage</h4>

Use the driver coins.lparallel.LoopPara instead of coins.driver.Driver.<p>

To output C file with OpenMP directives, type
<pre>
    java coins.lparallel.LoopPara -coins:hir2c foo.c
</pre>
where the C file named foo-loop.c will be output.<p>

To output executable (requires an OpenMP compiler named 'omcc'), type
<pre>
    java coins.lparallel.LoopPara foo.c
</pre>
This is just the above C output passed to an OpenMP compiler.
(There may be other configuration options, such as environment variables,
needed to execute the resultant eode in parallel: see your OpenMP compiler
manual.)<p>

The driver LoopPara also supports HIR optimization options supported by the 
driver coins.aflow.FlowOpt. For example,
<pre>
  java coins.lparallel.LoopPara -coins:hirOpt=cpf,hir2c foo.c
</pre>

This may enable some code that otherwize is not parallelizable to be 
parallelized.<p>

<h3 id='i-6-2'>6.2. Coarse Grain Parallelizing Module</h3>

<h4 id='i-6-2-1'>6.2.1.  OVERVIEW</h4>
<h5 id='i-6-2-1-1'>6.2.1.1.  Design Concept</h5>
    The coarse-grain parallelizing module is constructed for realizing a 
    coarse-grain parallelizing compiler named CoCo in java.  The CoCo is the
    research product and it is still at the infant stage as a parallelizing
    compiler.  Therefore it contains many constraints for practical usage as
    mentioned later.  We have found a lot of important issues which should be
    solved as practical coarse-grain parallelizing compilers by implementing
    the CoCo as an automatic parallelizing compiler.  The coarse-grain 
    parallelizing module is a part of the COINS infrastructure, and then the
    module components are available as a set of parts for coarse-grain 
    parallelization.<p>

    The CoCo analyzes an input C program and transforms it into a macro 
    (coarse-grain) task graph with data/control flow dependence.  Then, the 
    CoCo parallelizes the macro tasks by using OpenMP directives for SMP 
    machines. This analysis and transformation are carried out on Coins HIR
    (High-level Intermediate Representation).  The CoCo generates a parallel
    program in HIR containing OpenMP directives as comments.  The HIR program
    is translated into a C program with OpenMP directives by the HIR-to-C 
    translator.  Finally, it is compiled by the Omni-OpenMP compiler and then 
    executed in parallel on a SMP machine.<p>

    Macro tasks correspond to basic blocks, loops and/or subroutines.  After an
    input C program is divided into macro tasks, an execution starting
    condition of each macro task is analyzed.  The execution starting condition
    represents whether the macro task can be executed or not at a certain time.
    A runtime macro task scheduler evaluates an execution starting condition of
    each macro task at execution time, and dynamically assigns executable one
    to a light load processor of a SMP machine.<p>

    The coarse-grain parallelizing module is a tool set, which consists of the
    following functions:
<ol>
<li>Divides an input C program into macro tasks based on basic blocks,</li>
<li>Analyses an execution starting condition of each macro task,</li>
<li>Embeds OpenMP directives for parallel execution at a macro task 
           level,</li>
<li>Schedules dynamically each macro task to a processor of a SMP 
           machine. </li>
 </ol>

<h5 id='i-6-2-1-2'>6.2.1.2.  Data Structures</h5>
    The coarse-grain parallelizing module utilizes a macro flow graph model. 
    Nodes of the graph correspond macro tasks.  As for edges between nodes, 
    there are two types of edges representing control flow and data flow 
    dependences.<p>

    An execution starting condition is represented in a boolean expression.  
    The operators consist of 'logical AND' and/or 'logical OR'.  The operand 
    conditions are as follows:
<ol>
<li>If macro tasks with data dependence have been executed or decided
           not to be executed,</li>
<li> If control flow dependence to a macro task has been decided.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id='i-6-2-1-3'>6.2.1.3.  Scheduler</h5>
    The runtime macro task scheduler is independently attached to the main part
    of an output program.  If an input program is named 'xxx.c', the scheduler
    written in C language is located at the file named 'xxx-sch.c' at the same
    directory.<p>

<h4 id='i-6-2-2'>6.2.2.  CONSTRAINTS OF CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
    The current version of the coarse-grain parallelizing module, CoCo, has the
    following constraints:
<ol>
<li>The coarse-grain parallelizing module parallelizes only a main 
           function.  When an input program has several functions, the module
           ignores the other functions.</li>
<li>To execute a program in parallel efficiently, the module should 
           adjust grain granularity of tasks such as 'loop unrolling'.  Up to
           now, the module does not do that.</li>
<li> A loop in a program is translated into a single macro task.  The 
           module recognizes only reserved words in HIR such as 'while' and/or
           'for' as loops.  Other types of loop are not translated into macro
           tasks.</li>
<li>The module finds out an exit macro task only if the task has no 
           successors or includes return statements.  Other macro tasks which
           include 'exit()' functions, for example, are not recognized as exit
           ones.</li>
<li>When there are some macro tasks which have no dependence with each
           other, the execution order of macro tasks may be different from the
           order of sequential execution.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id='i-6-2-3'>6.2.3.  HOW TO USE</h4>
    The CoCo inserts OpenMP directives into a HIR program as comments for 
    coarse-grain parallelizing.  The CoCo utilizes 'hir2c' module, translator 
    from HIR to a C program, since the back end of Coins does not support the 
    OpenMP directives yet.  After a coarse-grain parallel C program is 
    generated by hir2c, you must compile it by an OpenMP compiler in order to 
    execute in parallel on a SMP machine.<p>

    To obtain a coarse-grain parallel program, you should operate as follows:
<ol>
<li> Compile 'xxx.c' by Coins C compiler specifying the option 
           '-coins: mdf, hir2c=opt'.</li>
<pre>
> java -classpath ./classes Driver -coins:mdf, hir2c=opt xxx.c
</pre>
<li>Compile the program with a runtime scheduler by Omni-OpenMP 'omcc'.</li>
<pre>
 > omcc xxx-hir-opt.c xxx-sch.c
</pre>
</ol>
