	<h1>12. Performance of COINS compilers</h1>
<p>    
COINS supports a wide range of optimizations such as SSA based optimizations and conventional optimizations based on data-flow analysis.
These optimizations are selectable by the compiler optins.
The backend process of COINS also has several basic optimization
processes such as register allocation, jump optimization, constant
foldings. These optimizations are always applied by default.
<p>
The relative execution times of
the SPEC benchmarks are shown in Fig.12-1.

In this figure, "COINS O0" means "COINS compiler: no optimization selected (only backend optimizations)", and "gcc O2" means "gcc compiler: with 
compiler option -O2". The target machine is x86 (Pentium 4).
<p>
This figure shows the good performance of the backend optimizations.
<p>
The effects of SSA optimizations and some added optimizations are
shown in Fig.12-2.

In this figure, the execution times of small programs are compared, where:
<pre><tt>isort:   insertion sort
ssort:   selection sort
heap:    heap sort
shell:   shell sort
queen:   8-queen
soukan:  correlation coefficient
komachi: "komachi" calculation
prime:   prime number
matmult: matrix multiplication

COINS 0:  COINS C compiler, no optimization selected
COINS 1:  COINS C compiler, with compiler options
            -coins:ssa-opt=prun/divex/cse/cstp/hli/osr/hli/cstp/cpyp/preqp/cstp/rpe/dce/srd3
COINS 2: COINS C compiler, with compiler options
            -coins:ssa-opt=prun/divex/cse/cstp/hli/osr/hli/cstp/cpyp/preqp/cstp/rpe/dce/srd3,
             attach=coins.backend.sched.Schedule,schedule,pipelining,attach=Regromote,regpromote
gcc O2:     gcc compiler, with compiler options "-O2"
gcc O3:     gcc compiler, with compiler options "-O3"

target machine:  SPARC (Sun Blade 1000)</tt>
</pre>
"schedule"  means instruction scheduling (with "nop"-instruction elimination, in case of SPARC), 
"pipelining" means software pipelining, and "regpromote" means register promotion of static variables.
See <a href='../backend/backend-frame.html' target="_top">11. Structure and Extensions of the Backend Process</a>
for these optimizations.
These are the added optimizations using the hook features of the backend process.
