	<h1>8. SSA Optimization for LIR</h1>

<h3 id='i-8-1'>8.1. OVERVIEW</h3>    

<h4 id='i-8-1-1'>8.1.1.  Introduction</h4>

    The SSA module includes optimizers on the Static Single Assignment form
    (SSA form). SSA is a representation where index is attached to every
    variable so that every definition of each variable in a program becomes
    unique.<br>
 At a joining point of the control flow graph where two or more
    different definitions of a variable reach, a hypothetical function
called a
    phi-function is inserted so that these multiple definitions are merged.<br>
    Data flow analysis and optimization for sequential execution can be
    compacted using SSA form. The SSA module is invoked on LIR.
  
<h4 id='i-8-1-2'>8.1.2. Translation to SSA form</h4>
    The translation pass of the SSA module translates normal LIR into LIR-level
    SSA form.<br>
    Translation into SSA form generally consists of two phases, insertion of
    phi-functions and the renaming of variables. Three types of SSA form are 
    well known: minimal SSA, semi-pruned SSA and pruned SSA. The algorithms for
    translating into these forms are almost the same, only the live variable
    analysis being different. The SSA module can translate into these types of 
    SSA form. See section 8.2.<p>

<h4 id='i-8-1-3'>8.1.3. Back translation from SSA form</h4>
    The back translation pass of the SSA module translates LIR-level SSA
form
    into normal LIR.<br>
    Generally, in the back translation from SSA form, the task of a
    phi-function is divided into the predecessor basic blocks. Therefore, in
    most cases, the translation inserts some copy statements for variables
used
    in the phi-function into the predecessor blocks of the basic block where
    the function resides, and then deletes the phi-function. The SSA module
    uses the method proposed by Briggs and the three methods proposed by
    Sreedhar to back translate from SSA form. See section 8.2.<p>

<h4 id='i-8-1-4'>8.1.4. Optimization</h4>
    Many optimizations based on SSA form are implemented, such as Common
    Subexpression Elimination, Constant Propagation, Copy Propagation, Dead
    Code Elimination and loop-related optimizations. The SSA module also
    includes tools for optimization, such as Split Critical Edge.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Demand-driven partial redundancy elimination based on global
value numbering&quot; is an efficient method of eliminating common 
sub-expressions and partially redundant expressions. 
It hoists loop-invariant expressions out of loop.<br>
<br>

In coins-1.5 and later versions, advanced optimization named
&quot;Scalar replacement by demand-driven partial redundancy elimination 
based on global value numbering&quot; (&quot;Scalar replacement by 
demand-driven PDE&quot; in brief) is available.<br>
It replaces memory accesses to register accesses. If it can be applied
within a heavy loop, execution speed will be increased remarkably.<br>

Let us explain the method using an example. In the inner loop of
<pre>
  for (i=0; i&lt;M; i=i+1) {
   for (j=1; j&lt;N; j=j+1) {
    a[j+1]=a[j-1]+b[i];
   }
   c[i]=a[N];
  }
</pre>
execution will proceed as follos:
<pre>
  a[2]=a[0]+b[i];
  a[3]=a[1]+b[i];
  a[4]=a[2]+b[i];
  a[5]=a[3]+b[i];
  a[6]=a[4]+b[i];
  ....
</pre>
If registers r0, r1, r2, r3 are available, then the above inner loop
can be executed as follows:
<pre>
  r0=b[i];
  r1=a[0]+r0;
  a[2]=r1;
  r2=a[1]+r0;
  a[3]=r2;
  r3=r1+r0;
  a[4]=r3;
  r1=r2+r0;
  a[5]=r1;
  r2=r3+r0;
  a[6]=r2;
  ....
</pre>
This transformation replaces memory accesses to elements of 
array <b>a</b> and array <b>b</b> to register accesses.<br>
For such transformation, it is necessary to recognize value 
identity of varaibles over loop iterations. In the above example,
the computation of a[j+1] uses the value of a[j-1] that is
computed 2 iterations earlier.<br>
The optimization &quot;Scalar replacement by demand-driven partial 
redundancy elimination based on global value numbering&quot; 
(&quot;Scalar replacement by demand driven PDE&quot; in brief) 
does such transformation to replace mamoey accesses to register
accesses. If such transformation is applied to heavy loops,
execution speed will be increased.<br>
<br>
In order to increase the effectiveness of such transformation, 
an option &quot;presrhir&quot; for HIR transformation is provided.
When the option<br>
&emsp; hirOpt=presrhir<br>
is specified, above loop will be expanded to such a loop as
<pre>
  for(i=0; i&lt;M;i=i+1) {
    j=0; v1=1; v3=2;
    for(; j&lt;N-v1; j=j+v3) {
      a[j+1]=a[j-1]+b[i]
      a[j+2]=a[j]+b[i];
    }
    for(; j&lt;N; j=j+1) {
      a[j+1]=a[j-1]+b[i];
    }
    c[i]=a[N];
  }
</pre>
and then the scalar replacement by demand-driven PDE will be
applied according to SSA options. An example of option 
specifications is <br>
&nbsp;  hirOpt=presrhir,<br>
&nbsp;  ssa-opt=prun/divex3/esplt/cstp/presr/cse/cstp/hli/osr/hli/cstp/eqp/dce/srd3<br>
<br>
The SSA optimizer options added for this purpose are<br>
<li>divex3 : &emsp;Divide expression into Three-Address Code<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(for Scalar replacement by demand-driven PDE).</li>
<li>eqp : &emsp;Demand-driven partial redundancy elimination without copy propagation<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(for decreasing required number of registers).</li>
<li>presr : &emsp;Do scalar replacement by demand-driven PRE.</li>
<br>
    You can specify the optimizers, tools and their order of application
using
    the SSA options. See section 8.2.

<h4 id='i-8-1-5'>8.1.5. Details</h4>
 For details of the SSA optimization module, see <a href='#reference'>[reference 1]</a>.

<h3 id='i-8-2'>8.2. SSA OPTIONS</h3>
   There are several compile time options for the SSA pass. For any other 
   options of the COINS Compiler Driver, see 
<a href='../driver/driver-frame.html' target="_top">2. How to use the Compiler Driver</a>
 or 
 <a href='../cc/cc-frame.html' target="_top">3. How to use C Compiler</a>.<p>
<pre>
-coins:lir-opt=...
</pre>
can also be used instead of
<pre>
-coins:ssa-opt=...
</pre>
(When ''lir-opt'' and ''ssa-opt'' are both written, only ''lir-opt'' is effective.)
<dl>
<dt> -coins:ssa-opt=&lt;optimizations-in-SSA-form&gt;/&lt;optimizations-in-normal-form&gt;/&lt;optimizations-in-SSA-form&gt;</dt><dd>
<p>
Use SSA pass. This is necessary for using the SSA module. There are
several
optimizations in this module. To invoke the optimization, you should
specify the optimizers with this option. Specified optimizers are
invoked from left to right. 
<p>
Both &lt;optimizations-in-SSA-form&gt; and &lt;optimizations-in-normal-form&gt; are optional with the separating &quot;/&quot;.<br>
<b>note:</b> &lt;optimizations-in-normal-form&gt; is available after coins-1.4.4.2.

<p>
&lt;optimizations-in-SSA-form&gt; is of the form &quot;xxx/yyy/.../zzz&quot;.
First, as `xxx' you MUST specify to which kind of
SSA form you like to translate, such as minimal, semi-pruned or pruned. And
then, as `yyy' you can specify the optimizers which the SSA module
invokes.
You can specify the same optimizer two times, three times, and so on.
Only optimizations that you specify are performed in that order. Finally, as
`zzz' you MUST specify how to back translate from SSA form.<p>

These options are defined as follows:

<ul>
<li>   Translation from normal form LIR to SSA form LIR<br>
      (You MUST specify one of them at the beginning of this SSA option)
<ul>
<li>        mini  :&emsp;&emsp; Translation to Minimal SSA form</li>
<li>        semi  :&emsp;&emsp; Translation to Semi-Pruned SSA form</li>
<li>        prun  :&emsp;&emsp; Translation to Pruned SSA form (recommended for optimization)</li>
</ul></li>

<li> Back Translation from SSA form LIR to normal form LIR<br>
      (You MUST specify one of them at the end of this SSA option)
<ul>
<li>        brig  :&emsp;&emsp; Back translation using Briggs's Method</li>
 <li>       srd1  : &emsp;&emsp;Back translation using Sreedhar's Method I</li>

 <li>       lir2c : &emsp;&emsp;Make C program from LIR</li>
<!-- ******************** Begin 2013.7 -->
  <li>      glia  :&emsp;&emsp; Global Load Instruction Aggregation<br>
<ul>
    (Specifying the glia option causes the load instructions accessing 
    to the same array to be aggregated continuously, so that cache hit
    ratio can increase. At this time, since useless code motion in
    the aggregation is suppressed,  the register pressure increased 
    by the aggregation can be suppressed.<br>
     Depending on the characteristics of the cache and input 
    program, there may be a case where the cache hit ratio decrease.)
</ul>
</li>
<!-- ******************** End -->
</ul></li>
<li>     LIR Line numbering(available after coins-1.4.4.4)
<ul>
<li>        stlin  : &emsp;&emsp;Put a line number to each LIR</li>
<li>        inslin : &emsp;&emsp;Insert LIRs representing line numbers</li>

</li>
<li>After coins-1.5, the following optimizations for non-SSA forms can be 
specified for &quot;Scalar replacement by demand-driven partial redundancy 
elimination based on global value numbering&quot;
(Scalar replacement by demand-driven PRE in brief.)<br>
</li>
<ul>
<li>divex3 : &emsp;&emsp;Divide expression into Three-Address Code<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (for Scalar replacement by demand driven PDE).</li>
<li>eqp : &emsp;&emsp;Demand-driven partial redundancy elimination without copy propagation<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(for decreasing required number of registers).</li>
<li>presr : &emsp;&emsp;Do scalar replacement by demand-driven PRE.</li>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<b>note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The option lcm may take long compilation time.</li>
<li>It is not allowed to specify multiple uses of cntbb.</li>
<li>In the x86_64-mac architecture cntbb options are not allowed because of their use of calling fprintf function.</li>
<li>Cntbb doesn't count the following LIR instructions: PHI instruction, PROLOGUE instruction, EPILOGUE instruction, and LIR instructions used for counting instructions.</li>
<li>Results of &quot;cntbb&quot; option are written down on files &lt;Filename&gt;.&lt;Functionname&gt;.cnt in the working directory where &lt;Filename&gt; and &lt;Functionname&gt; are the file name and function name of the source program respectively.
Cntbb uses a working directory which is indicated with the COINS option ``tmpdir''.
If the option is not specified, ``/tmp'' is used as the working directory.</li>
<li>The counting instructions option counts the number of executed LIR instructions with compilation twice and execution once.
At the first compilation, the information which is referenced at the second compilation is written into the file file_list.dat in the working directory.
So before the first compilation the file should be removed, if it exists.
To remove the working file file_list.dat and results of &quot;cntbb&quot;, coins.ssa.ProApp is available.</li>
<li>
To show the counted result of LIR instructions, use the following command:
<pre>
    java -cp ./classes coins.ssa.ProApp -t xxxx
</pre>
where, ``-t'' option specifies xxx as the working directory.
If ``-t'' option is not given, ``/tmp'' directory is used.
<br>
To erase the file_list.dat in  the working directory, use the following command:
<pre>
    java -cp ./classes coins.ssa.ProApp -t xxxx -n
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The options stlin, inslin, rmlin, shlin are used to set line number to 
each LIR instructions.
There is another option ``-coins:debuginfo'' that gives source line number
to some of LIR instructions.  There are many LIR instructions that are difficult
to be made correspondence with source line number, and the source line 
information is lost during SSA optimization.  The above options for LIR
line numbering give a sequence number for each LIR instructions and this
number is preserved in the process of SSA optimization.  The source line
number is a positive integer, however, the LIR line number is a negative
integer.  You may see the correspondence of the LIR line number and the 
source line number for some LIR instructions.
As an example, give a sequence of ssa-options
<pre>
    -coins:ssa-opt=stlin/shlin/prun/shlin/cse/shlin/srd3/shlin 
</pre>
then you may see the movement of instructions for some LIR instructions 
in the process of SSA optimization.
</li>
<li>See &quot;Optimization in Static Single Assignment Form - External Specification&quot; (in Japanese) for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>
&lt;optimizations-in-normal-form&gt; is of the form &quot;www/...&quot;.
You can specify as `www' the following options.
<ul>
<li>Optimization
<ul>
<li>pdeqp : &emsp;&emsp;Partial Dead Code Elimination based on Question Propagation</li>
<li>divex2 : &emsp;&emsp;Divide expression into Three-Address Code (divex applied to normal form)</li>
<li>esplt : &emsp;&emsp;Split Critical Edge</li>
<!-- ******************** Begin 2013.7 -->
<li>      expde  :&emsp;&emsp; Exhaustive Partial Dead Code Elimination
  <ul>
    (The application of partial dead code elimination results in
    second order effects that expose other partially dead assignments.
    Specifying the expde option causes the partial dead code 
    elimination to be repeatedly applied until no second order 
    effect occurs. This option may increase compilation time.)
  </ul>
</li>
<li>      ddpde  :&emsp;&emsp; Demand-Driven Partial Dead Code Elimination
  <ul>
    (DDPDE (demand-driven partial dead code elimination) enables
    restricting the region analyzed by PDE (partial dead code elimination)
    for each assignment. Specifying the ddpde option causes 
    DDPDE to be applied to all assignments in topsort order, so that
    most second order effects can be caught in the same cost as one
    time application of the traditional PDE. )
  </ul>
</li>
<!-- ******************** End -->
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example (&lt;optimizations-in-SSA-form&gt;) : If you specify the option
<pre>
-coins:ssa-opt=prun/cstp/cse/srd3
</pre>
    the SSA module performs the following in that order:
<ol>
<li> make pruned SSA form</li> 
<li>  invoke constant folding and propagation with conditional branches</li>
<li> invoke common subexpression elimination</li>
<li> back translate using Sreedhar's Method III</li>
</ol>
<p>
Example (&lt;optimizations-in-normal-form&gt;/&lt;optimizations-in-SSA-form&gt;)
<pre>
  -coins:ssa-opt=divex2/esplt/pdeqp/prun/divex/cse/cstp/hli/osr/hli/cstp/cpyp/preqp/cstp/rpe/dce/srd3
</pre>
&quot;divex2/esplt/pdeqp&quot; is &lt;optimizations-in-normal-form&gt; and the rest is &lt;optimizations-in-SSA-form&gt;.
<p>
<!-- Begin 2013.7 -->

Following is an example that specifies the options ddpde and glia.
<pre>
  -coins:ssa-opt=divex2/esplt/pdeqp/ddpde/expde/prun/divex/cse/cstp/hli/osr/hli/cstp/cpyp/preqp/cstp/rpe/glia/dce/srd3
</pre>
<!-- End 2013.7 -->
</dd>

<dt> -coins:ssa-no-change-loop</dt><dd>
    Before the optimizations, the SSA module changes the structure of the loops
as follows, by default. This is for making effective loop optimization.
<ol>
<li> merge the several loops that have the same header block</li>
<li> insert the preheader</li>
<li>change the loop structure from `while' type to `do-while' type 
           (precisely `if-do-while'). The `while' type is a loop such that
           the header and exit block of the loop are the same block.</li>
</ol>
  
    The above is performed by default. If you DO NOT want to do that, specify
    this option.</dd>

<dt> -coins:ssa-no-copy-folding</dt><dd>
    During the translation to the SSA form, the SSA module removes and
    propagates the copy-assign statements such as `x=y', by default.<p>

    If you DO NOT want to do that, specify this option.</dd>

<dt> -coins:ssa-no-redundant-phi-elimination</dt><dd>
    The SSA module eliminates redundant phi-functions after the translation
    to the SSA form, by default. A phi-function is redundant if:
<ol>
<li>the names of the target and the arguments of the phi-function are
           all the same as follows: 
<pre>  x1=phi(x1,x1,x1)</pre></li>
<li> the names of the arguments of the phi-function are all the same as follows:
<pre> x1=phi(y1,y1,y1)</pre></li>
<li> there are also other cases as follows:  
<pre>x1=phi(y1,y1,x1)   or   x1=phi(y1,y1,BOTTOM)</pre></li>
</ol>

    In the first case, the SSA module just eliminates the phi-function.
    In the second case, the SSA module eliminates the phi-function and replaces
    uses of `x1' by `y1' in the statements which are evaluated after the
    phi-function.<br>
    For further details, see <a href='#reference'>[reference 1]</a>.<p>
 
    If you DO NOT want to do that, specify this option.</dd>

<dt> -coins:ssa-no-sreedhar-coalescing</dt><dd>
     During the back translation from SSA form by Sreedhar's method,
    the SSA module coalesces copy-related variables in SSA form, by default.
    This coalescing is proposed by Sreedhar and is called the SSA-based
    coalescing. 
    This coalescing module is usually unified with Sreedhar's algorithm for
    back translation from SSA form. But for researchers' convenience, the
SSA 
    module can avoid it.<p>

    If you DO NOT want to do SSA based coalescing, specify this option.</dd>

<dt> -coins:ssa-with-chaitin-coalescing</dt><dd>
    Perform coalescing proposed by Chaitin after the back translation to 
    normal form. This coalesces copy-related variables whose live ranges do not
    interfere each other. In general, after the back translation from SSA form,
     there may be some copy assignment statements in the program. Some copy
    assignment statements only change the names of variables, that is, they
are
    useless. Coalescing these variables eliminates the useless copy
assignment
    statements. This optimization is done in normal form LIR after the back
    translation from SSA form. <p>

    If you WANT to do that, specify this option.<br>
   (This coalescing can be specified after any back translation method.
     But it may have no effect after the back translation by Sreedhar's
     Method III since that method does not insert copy assignment statements
     which can be coalesced by Chaitin's coalescing.)
</dd>

<dt> -coins:ssa-no-memory-analysis</dt><dd>
    When Common Subexpression Elimination and/or Global Value Numbering and
    Partial Redundancy Elimination with Efficient Question Propagation are 
    specified, the SSA module makes a simple alias analysis of memory accesses,
    by treating the whole memory as a single entity. (cf. section 8 of
    <a href='#reference'>[reference 1]</a>)<p>

    If you DO NOT want to do that, specify this option.</dd>

<dt> -coins:ssa-no-replace-by-exp</dt><dd>
    Just before the back translation from SSA form, the SSA module finds the 
    local variables, which are not &quot;live out&quot; from the current basic block
    and are used only once in the current basic block, and replaces the 
    variables by the expressions which define the variables. (cf. section
5.4.6
    &quot;preprocessing for temporary variables&quot; of  <a href='#reference'>[reference 1]</a>)<p>

    If you DO NOT want to do that, specify this option.</dd>

<dt> -coins:trace=SSA.xxxx</dt><dd>
    To output the trace information of this SSA module for debugging, specify 
    the trace level as follows:
<pre>
        1     : Output only the message that the SSA module is invoked
        100   : Output the agenda of the SSA module
        1500  : Output two kinds of information:
                (a) The inserted phi-functions when the SSA module translates 
                   normal LIR into SSA form.
                (b) The inserted copy assign statements when the SSA module 
                   back translates SSA form into normal LIR.
        2000  : Output general debug information of all optimizers in the SSA 
                module
        10000 : Output much information about Sreedhar's Method III
</pre>
    The trace information includes the levels less than or equal to what you specified. If you
    specify 
<pre>trace=SSA.1500</pre>
then the SSA module outputs information related 
    to the level `1', `100' and `1500'.</dd>

<dt>-coins:ssa-opt=.../dump/...</dt><dd>
    For compiler developers, the SSA module provides the option `dump'
    for debugging. This option should be specified within `ssa-opt'.
    When this option is specified, the SSA module outputs the current LIR
    into the standard output.
    For example, if the option is specified as follows:

  <pre> -coins:ssa-opt=prun/dump/srd3/dump</pre>

    the SSA module outputs the LIR (1) after translation into the
    pruned SSA form, and (2) after back translation from SSA form.</dd>

<dt>-coins:regalloc=oca</dt><dd>
The register allocation algorithm, ''Optimistic Register Coalescing'' can be selected by this option. 
When this option is not specified, the default register allocation algorithm ''Iterated Register Coalescing'' is used. 
This option is available after coins-1.4.4.4.</dd>
