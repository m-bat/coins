	<h1>Basic Parallelization Facilities</h1>

<p>COINS provides following facilities for parallelization.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loop analyzer to discriminate whether a loop can be executed 
in parallel as a do-all loop.</li>
<li>Normalize a loop to conform to do-all type pallelization.</li>
<li>Generate OpenMP program for a program containing normalized do-all loops.</li>
<li>Generate machine code for a program containing normalized do-all loops.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Loop Analyzer </h3>

<p>The loop analyzer investigates memory access areas for each loop to find
the possibility of overlap of access areas between iterations of the loop
by using the result of control flow and data flow analysis.
The analyzer judges following loops as parallelizable.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no possibility of memory area overlap between loop iterations.</li>
<li>Memory area overlap is only caused by induction variables.</li>
<li>The loop is a reduction loop computing summation, subtraction of summation,
multiplication of a sequence of array elements.</li>
<li>By shifting the region of loop index, the loop can be changed to a loop conforming to one of above cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis is done from inner-most loop to outer-most loop.
 Subprograms and loops to be analyzed can be specified by pragma.</p>
 
<h3>Loop Normalization </h3>

<p>A loop is changed to a for-loop with loop index changing its value 0, 1, 2, ...
in such form as</p>
<pre>
    for (i = 0; i < n; i = i + 1) { .... }
</pre>
<p>where, i is the loop index and n is the iteration count.</p>
<p>All induction variables (integer variable that increases/decreases by a fixed 
 number by iteration) are detected and their values are computed from
the loop index. Corresponding to the change of induction variable 
representation, array element expressions are changed accordingly.</p>

<h3>OpenMP program generation </h3>

<p>For normalized do-all loops, OpenMP directives are attached so that
 the loop can be executed in parallel by using an OpenMP compiler.
For loops that failed to be parallelized, the reason of failure
will be indicated by comment. The resultant program is generated 
as a C program with OpenMP directives and comments by using
HIR-to-C translator of COINS.</p>

<h3>Machine code generation for parallel execution </h3>

<p>If machine code generation for parallel execution is specified by
compile command, then each of do-all loops selected by pragma
is transformed to a subprogram to be executed as a slave thread and the original
program is cahnged to be executed as master thread without using OpenMP.
The program can be executed in parallel by linking with run-time routine 
that controls parallel execution.</p>
