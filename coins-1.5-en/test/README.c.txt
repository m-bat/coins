README.c.txt

The directory c contains test programs written in c.
These programs can be used for testing compiler as it is 
explained in 
  doc-en/README.TestPrograms.en.txt
in the archive file.

For some test programs, it is required to see generated object code
or intermediate results in order to confirm that compilation is 
successfully done. For example, test programs under the directories 
Opt, OptAdd and TestSsa are prepared for testing optimization and their 
object code should be examined. Intermediate results can be get by 
specifying trace compiler option as it is explained in
  doc-en/README.driver.en.txt 
in the archive file.
